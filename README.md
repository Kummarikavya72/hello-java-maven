# hello-java-maven
As part of Task 8, I successfully created a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline in Jenkins for a simple Java Maven project. I used an Amazon Linux EC2 instance where Jenkins was running inside a Docker container. First, I set up Jenkins with the necessary ports and mounted volumes to persist Jenkins data and link it to the project directory. After Jenkins was running, I created a Java Maven project named hello-java-maven, which included a basic HelloWorld.java file and a pom.xml file for dependency and build configuration. I ensured that the POM file was correctly written, fixing any tag errors like <bulid> to <build>. Once the project structure was ready, I pushed the code to my GitHub repository.
In Jenkins, I created a Freestyle job and connected it to my GitHub repository under the Source Code Management section. For the build step, I chose "Invoke top-level Maven targets" and entered the goal as clean package. When I triggered the build, Jenkins fetched the code from GitHub, compiled the Java application using Maven, and generated a JAR file. I verified that the build was successful by checking the console output, which showed BUILD SUCCESS, and confirmed that the compiled JAR file was available inside the target directory. This task helped me understand how to connect GitHub, Jenkins, and Maven to automate the build process, and I gained hands-on experience in setting up a CI pipeline from scratch.
